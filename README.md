The get_next_line project at 42 is about creating a function that reads a file line by line.
It efficiently handles different types of input, such as files or standard input, returning one line at a time without storing everything in memory.

# Key Features 🔄💾
- Reads from any file descriptor (files, stdin, etc.).

- Uses a buffered approach to optimize memory usage.

- Handles multiple file descriptors simultaneously.

# Challenges & Learning 🧠👨‍💻
- Memory management: Avoiding leaks while handling dynamic allocations.

- File handling: Managing file descriptors and reading efficiently.

- Buffer management: Working with a predefined buffer size for optimized performance.
